# Advanced_statistics_and_probabilty

This is a computational project I made in collaboration with Maria Pasinetti, for the Statistics and probability exam handed by Prof. Stefano Zapoeri. 
The dataset I used deals with ${CO_{2}}$ emissions cumulative and pro capite for every comune of every state joining to European Union. 

We did a qualitative and quantitative analysis about the problematics every state has to face in sight of climate change.
